1
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.847
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's Thomas Middleditch.

2
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.849
- That's Ben Schwartz.
- We're Middleditch and Schwartz.

3
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.249
- Oh, what fun.
- What fun.

4
00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.685
You know what I realized
when we were clapping?

5
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.835
Because, we're filming this.

6
00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:47.589
The higher we look, the more people
it looks like are in the audience.

7
00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.342
So, it's like this in the balcony,
second balcony, third balcony...

8
00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.677
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.055
We're playing to a stadium
of 40,000 people.

10
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.973
- This is...
- In terms of the special.

11
00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.058
Forty thousand.

12
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.351
A person in the very last row, scream.

13
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.064
That person is seven miles away.

14
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.649
And that person is my dad.

15
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.817
Thank you, Dad.

16
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.069
Thank you, Daddy.

17
00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.155
Really crappy that he got
the worst seat in the house.

18
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.966
- But I worked hard for it.
- Thank you, Daddy.

19
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.868
Does anyone say it like that
to their actual dad?

20
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.829
"Thanks, Daddy."

21
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.748
A round of applause.

22
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.374
Who here, man or woman,

23
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:27.087
has said, "Thank you, Daddy,"
to your actual father?

24
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.049
Alright, sure.

25
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.219
- Sure.
- All right, sweetheart.

26
00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:35.970
Yeah sure, just be back by 11:00.

27
00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.433
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Yes.

28
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.770
Well, I'm going to watch Forged In Fire.

29
00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.564
I'm a dad.

30
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.024
I am very excited.

31
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.193
- Okay. Alright.
- We are very excited to be here

32
00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.821
to perform long form improv.
This is what we're gonna do.

33
00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.698
We're gonna make up every word,
every character, every sentence.

34
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.342
Everything will be made up on the spot.

35
00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.202
This show... What we usually say

36
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.411
and what I almost said is,

37
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.123
this show exists in this moment
for us and nobody else,

38
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.916
but that is very different today.

39
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.253
It's going to be recorded
and put online in perpetuity.

40
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.423
This is what's going to happen.
We'll ask the audience a question.

41
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.218
And what we want from that
is not a joke answer.

42
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.021
We want to go back and forth with you
and have a little conversation,

43
00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:21.099
and that will be the inspiration
for our show.

44
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.768
- Thomas.
- Is there anything, uh...

45
00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.645
you know... something to think about.

46
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.898
Is there anything that's coming up
in the near future

47
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.650
that you're either excited about

48
00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.110
or maybe dreading perhaps?

49
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:33.069
Elections!

50
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.154
- My birthday!
- Finals!

51
00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.321
- Anniversary!
- My in-laws!

52
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.573
I heard...

53
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:38.616
Finals...

54
00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.203
- I like finals, I think maybe.
- Alright.

55
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.723
- Well, let's ask a little bit.
- That's the first one we heard.

56
00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.416
- Yeah, let's pry into that.
- Okay.

57
00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.876
- Who said finals?
- I did.

58
00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.795
Right here. And you're the first
who said, "Hello, Daddy." Correct?

59
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.592
Are you...? Is this for the end of it,
for the whole thing?

60
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.595
Law school!
It's my first semester of law school.

61
00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.096
First semester of law school!

62
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.224
There's probably so much studying,
I'm assuming.

63
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.350
There's so many things.

64
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.810
What's article 3.12 A?

65
00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:09.230
You've got to study.

66
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.150
Is it here at NYU?

67
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.069
No, I go to... it's out of Harrisburg.

68
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.071
- I go to Widener.
- Where's Harrisburg?

69
00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.283
Harrisburg sounds like a battle
from the Civil War.

70
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.537
Harrisburg sounds like like
5,000 lost on both sides.

71
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.082
"But it was a turning point..."

72
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.166
That's it.

73
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.377
Harrisburg sounds like
a History Channel bit...

74
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.087
- For dads.
- ...for dads.

75
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.381
There might be aliens in Harrisburg,
so you're fine.

76
00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.401
- That guy with the thing.
- Aliens in Harrisburg?

77
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.469
Thank you for that.

78
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.847
Give us a taste of what
law school has been like...

79
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.766
- Yeah.
- ...and who you hang out with.

80
00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.368
I still work full-time during the day,

81
00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.494
- so I go at night.
- What do you work as?

82
00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:49.437
I work for an insurance company.

83
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.730
I do customer service.

84
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.000
- Insurance company. Okay.
- Customer service. Insurance.

85
00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.443
- So, you're double timing it.
- Customer service.

86
00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:56.945
And I have kids. So, you know.

87
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.072
- And you've got kids?
- And you have kids!

88
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.534
Do you have a favorite
or least favorite professor at law school?

89
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.452
I do.

90
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.055
And it's a thumbs up or a thumbs down?

91
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.915
Uh, they're all thumbs up,
all really good.

92
00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.959
But my Contracts professor
is pretty funny.

93
00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.753
- A cool teacher.
- This teacher's pretty cool.

94
00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:14.836
Yeah.

95
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.297
Pretty cool teacher.

96
00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:18.154
You are juggling quite a few things,

97
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.260
and you're pulling it off,
which is impressive.

98
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.513
What's the most exciting part of it?
What's the scariest part of it?

99
00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.392
Scariest part is when I talk to my kids,

100
00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:30.019
and my younger son tells me
that he's really excited

101
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.503
that I'm going to change the world.

102
00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:34.649
And I want to change the world,
but he wishes I could be home.

103
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.276
- So, that's...
- That's real.

104
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.697
For those of you in the back
that didn't hear...

105
00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.367
she's upset that she wants
to change the world

106
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.953
and her son says,
or her youngest kid says,

107
00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.330
"I'm just upset you're
not home more often."

108
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.332
Oh, you didn't hear. Okay.

109
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.420
So, that's your youngest son.
You have another kid as well?

110
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:56.546
I have an older son, yes.

111
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.773
- So, you have two sons.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.090
And what's the older son like?

113
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.009
He likes board games.
He likes Magic.

114
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:01.926
We love board games.

115
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.029
- We love magic. This kid sound great.
- He loves MTG?

116
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:05.221
- MTG?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.181
Tapping all the powers and the mana?
Hell yeah.

118
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.266
And what do you do?

119
00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:11.078
- I teach my kids Magic. It's terrible.
- You teach your kids magic?

120
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:12.478
- Yeah.
- Are you a big magic fan?

121
00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.606
- Okay, give me one more.
- You're thinking about magic,

122
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.108
and we're talking Magic.

123
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.069
You're not talking about magic?

124
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.697
You're talking about Magic?

125
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.781
Yeah. Tap, tap, tap.

126
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.385
I'm sorry, you're talking about Magic?

127
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.035
And not, like... magic?

128
00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.118
Yeah.

129
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.747
Okay. So you're the one
who teaches them Magic.

130
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.335
They like to hide, like, toy spiders,
and stuffed animals,

131
00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.338
in really awkward places
like the fucking shower.

132
00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:38.504
They're goofing you.

133
00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.881
They're playing pranks.

134
00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.966
You got prankies, you got pranky goofs.

135
00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.718
Pranky goofs.

136
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.597
Anything else about that law school
we need to know or no?

137
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.184
There's, uh... interesting...

138
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.352
Yeah, keep going.

139
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.356
- There's an interesting...
- Interesting group of people.

140
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.024
So, we run the gamut

141
00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:01.778
from mid 20s, 30s most of the people...

142
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.447
And then there's a gentleman
who likes to remind us

143
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.116
that he's from Maryland and he is...

144
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.329
There's a guy who likes
to remind you that he's from Maryland.

145
00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.748
- I want to repeat so everybody can...
- Literally.

146
00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:15.271
- take that in.
- He's from Maryland.

147
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.336
- So nothing he learns applies.
- Nothing he learns applies.

148
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.423
Uh, everything that he talks about,
he will...

149
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.219
Two of our four professors are women.

150
00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.013
So he likes to "mansplain"
the things that they teach him back.

151
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.474
He's mansplaining the female professors.

152
00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:34.477
- He ignores...
- No, the other students.

153
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.562
- No, the professors.
- The professors.

154
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.646
Ah, ah, ah...

155
00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.316
But he's from Maryland, though.

156
00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.237
- I feel like you don't get it.
- He's also like...

157
00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.074
- Let me explain it to you.
- And, honestly, that makes sense.

158
00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.719
- Okay, that's terrible, it's terrifying.
- Okay, that's great.

159
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.495
- That's good.
- What else we got?

160
00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:56.290
Every time another woman,
another female student, talks,

161
00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.875
he likes to then raise his hand,

162
00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.878
and basically say exactly the same thing
that we said,

163
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.642
- except as a statement...
- What a bummer.

164
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:03.899
Are you happy?
I think that's enough.

165
00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:04.757
I think it's great.

166
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.384
Give it up one time, everybody.

167
00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.927
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

168
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.640
Ladies and gentlemen,
we present to you,

169
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:13.850
Middleditch and Schwartz.

170
00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:54.140
Um...

171
00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:05.485
Just making sure nobody's cheating.

172
00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:09.362
Right?

173
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.615
This is the test?

174
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:13.618
Are you studying right now?

175
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.411
- Yeah.
- Okay, good. Great.

176
00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.748
I'm taking a private test.

177
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.917
Yes. She's...

178
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.085
She's taking a private test right now.

179
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.796
I'm taking a private test
that no one else is taking,

180
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.760
but you want to make sure
that I'm not cheating.

181
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:29.300
- Right.
- Got it.

182
00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:31.469
- You can keep doing what you're doing.
- Okay.

183
00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.138
Good to see you.

184
00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:38.768
I'm so nervous.

185
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.021
I don't know.
I barely know what I'm doing.

186
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.898
I'm taking that test...

187
00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:44.981
next week.

188
00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.251
You're taking this test?

189
00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:49.737
Do you want the answers?

190
00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.322
I can give them to you.

191
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.950
Hey!

192
00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:56.494
This is great!

193
00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.828
I know.

194
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:09.881
Ah...

195
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.676
Yes, Stanley?

196
00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:13.678
- Stanley... from Maryland?
- Yeah.

197
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.931
I just...

198
00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:18.599
want to make sure that...

199
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.435
everyone's eyes are looking around

200
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.479
to make sure that nobody's cheating.

201
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.481
Especially, um...

202
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.275
the women in the class.

203
00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:31.362
Why would we be cheating?

204
00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:36.367
I just feel, just if you look at...

205
00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:39.078
I feel like if we delved into the stats...

206
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.790
- Okay.
- If we delved into the stats,

207
00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:46.335
we'd find probably a little bit more
instances of cheating amongst...

208
00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.461
women...

209
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.589
is my stance.

210
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.053
And like...

211
00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:58.054
fucking...

212
00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.099
turtles are our mascot.

213
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.269
Uh...

214
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.354
Anyway, if you're going to walk,

215
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.898
make sure you do
one foot in front of the other.

216
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:11.193
- Thank you, Stanley.
- You got it.

217
00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.153
Thank you.

218
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.321
Hey, thank you.

219
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:15.990
Yea. Thank you. Yea.

220
00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.617
Alright.

221
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.453
Alright, are you finished?

222
00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:22.078
Yeah, I'm all set.

223
00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:23.663
Thank you.

224
00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:25.475
I'm going to grade this right here.

225
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:26.834
In front of everybody?

226
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.878
I'm sorry you failed.

227
00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:34.967
If I failed, then honestly,
I'm going to leave this room forever.

228
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.929
Yeah!

229
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.766
Leave this room forever!

230
00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:44.810
Yeah, there's, like,
way more other students here, too.

231
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:45.894
Yeah.

232
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.771
Great.

233
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980
Fine.

234
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.357
I'll leave.

235
00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.360
And I'm never coming back.

236
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.989
- Alright, take care.
- My name is Christina.

237
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.951
And I'm never coming back.

238
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.287
Who cares?

239
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.499
Alright, Christina.

240
00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.794
Christina, do you know that, uh...

241
00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:12.880
that cotton blend you're wearing
looks stupid? Take care.

242
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.051
I love this cotton blend.

243
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.102
Which... reminds me, class... um...

244
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.604
If I can remind anyone...

245
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.399
Uh...

246
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.485
I want you guys
to take this test seriously.

247
00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.070
I know we've...

248
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.030
had a bunch of laughs here.

249
00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:41.784
You're so funny.

250
00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:42.868
Ah...

251
00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:45.579
I know we've goofed around a lot,

252
00:11:45.746 --> 00:11:46.746
but... uh...

253
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.206
I'm serious.

254
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:51.668
I'm... uh...

255
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.171
I'm serious now, okay?

256
00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.255
And...

257
00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:58.968
I really want to see
you guys pass and I'm...

258
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.095
I can't play favorites here, you know?

259
00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:02.513
We all loved Christina.

260
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.059
And we didn't want to see her go,

261
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.103
- especially permanently.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.650
So, I don't want to see the same thing
happen to you guys,

263
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.610
so please take the test seriously.

264
00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:20.364
And let's all agree that we can
take the test together next time.

265
00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:21.907
Absolutely.

266
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.118
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

267
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.411
- Alright.
- Knock, knock...

268
00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.163
Wait. Alright.

269
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.247
Who's there?

270
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.542
- Boo.
- Boo who?

271
00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:34.420
I'm not crying.

272
00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.007
Whoa!

273
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.052
Yeah.

274
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.390
Uh...

275
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.725
Whoa!

276
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:51.729
I'll just write on the board
for a little bit.

277
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.316
Hey, Teach?

278
00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:57.859
Yeah?

279
00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:00.236
Uh...

280
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:10.122
I just want to say
you've really inspired us.

281
00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:12.291
At least me, and I'm sure all of us.

282
00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.086
And I want to say I'm just...

283
00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.631
I am going to pass. I know it.

284
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.925
And... I don't know.

285
00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:24.178
I really wanted to help change things
for the better. You know?

286
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.222
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:28.474
Hey, that's why we're here.
You know what I mean?

288
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:34.188
We're trying to change things
for the better.

289
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:35.856
- Right?
- Exactly.

290
00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:38.359
More protections
for Executive power.

291
00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:40.861
No. No.

292
00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.739
The President can do no wrong.

293
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.200
The President can do no...

294
00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:47.368
Ah...

295
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.037
Sto... Stop chanting.

296
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.500
Fuck you, Nigel!

297
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.335
No. Stop chanting.

298
00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:00.214
I'm from Maryland, okay?

299
00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:01.882
- I know.
- We chant.

300
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.844
Some of us are from different countries.

301
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.181
And some of us just want to pass the class
so we can thrive here.

302
00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.348
Okay?

303
00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:11.934
You're from another country?

304
00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.017
Yes.

305
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.729
- Where are you from?
- I'll never tell.

306
00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:29.577
Yes, and some of us
are from right here in America.

307
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.204
There's no fucking way.

308
00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.456
There's no fucking way
you're from America.

309
00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:39.044
Yes, I am from one of the 50 states.

310
00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.172
Much like you are from Maryland.

311
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.091
I am from Maryland.

312
00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:45.174
Yes, yes.

313
00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.303
We never will forget that.

314
00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:50.138
Very cool.

315
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.307
Yes, very cool.

316
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.726
- Very cool.
- Yes, look at us...

317
00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:56.186
We are three males in the class.

318
00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:59.106
Why are you...? Okay.

319
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.233
Yes, and there is one...

320
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.652
What... Let's say our names.

321
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.239
I'm Nigel.

322
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.116
- You know me. I'm Nigel.
- Yes, yes.

323
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.242
And your American name?

324
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.368
My American name?

325
00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.037
My normal...

326
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.830
It's always been my name.

327
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:17.624
Sss...

328
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.585
You shouldn't have to think so hard.

329
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:21.712
Stanley.

330
00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.675
So, we have two Stanleys.

331
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.301
Yes.

332
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.262
- Okay.
- Yes.

333
00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.430
I just...

334
00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.557
You know, for variety's sake.

335
00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.060
Let's put it on the board.

336
00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:37.394
- Two Stanleys.
- Yea.

337
00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.146
- Stanley and Stanley.
- Seems a bit late

338
00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:40.856
to be coming acquainted
with one another,

339
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.483
but I think it's important.

340
00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:45.194
The good news is we haven't
taken the test yet.

341
00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.363
It's later on so we can pack
any piece of knowledge

342
00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.114
we want to enter our brains right now.

343
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.366
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Alright?

344
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.909
Like, listen first of all...

345
00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.203
Contracts, right?

346
00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.288
- Yes, yes good.
- Sounds boring, right?

347
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.581
- Yeah.
- Okay.

348
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.836
What if I take this contract,
take the first piece out,

349
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.505
fold it up like an airplane?

350
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:05.798
What the fuck was that?

351
00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:17.601
I don't know, Teach, what was it?

352
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:21.522
I don't know.
Why don't you ask your kids?

353
00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.483
What the fuck?

354
00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:28.278
Was that supposed to be a punchline?

355
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.864
- Yeah, did you like it?
- Not really.

356
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.033
- Sort of felt antagonistic.
- Oh...

357
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.743
I've... I get it.

358
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.078
American humor.

359
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.246
Uh, uh, uh...

360
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.583
What else, Teach?

361
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:49.549
Okay.

362
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.928
Every contract ends
with a little line at the bottom

363
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.680
where you sign that name. Right?

364
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:58.267
You put your little John Hancock
down there.

365
00:16:58.726 --> 00:16:59.726
Am I right?

366
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.186
Yeah, John Hancock.

367
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.604
Not Jenny Hancock.

368
00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:05.733
It could be Jenny Hancock.

369
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:06.900
I don't know, man.

370
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:13.781
Anyway...

371
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:18.495
Soon as you do that,
it's legally binding.

372
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.711
Are you fucking surfing?

373
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.345
Wow.

374
00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.722
Whoa!

375
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:39.098
Mm...

376
00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.479
We don't play that here.

377
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.522
- Right, we don't.
- Stanley.

378
00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.566
Of course. We don't.

379
00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:51.445
Teach, I'm nervous for the test to be.

380
00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:54.490
You've changed.

381
00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:58.077
Mm, unless there's another class member...

382
00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.703
No, no, no, I'm Stanley.

383
00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:00.805
I'm Stanley.

384
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:02.706
I'm Stanley?

385
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.790
I'm Stanley?

386
00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:06.460
Wait. What's...
Hey, what's your name again?

387
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:09.463
- I'm Stanley.
- Great.

388
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.632
- Yes. Okay.
- You're Stanley.

389
00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.342
- Yes.
- I'm Stanley.

390
00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:14.510
I'm Stanley.

391
00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:15.843
Great.

392
00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:16.969
Stanley.

393
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:19.306
Is that what you wanted to say?

394
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.683
I guess I don't have to say it.

395
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.393
It's written on the board. So...

396
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.105
- Now you're sounding like me!
- Fuck!

397
00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:29.233
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

398
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.443
What is the meaning of this poppycock?

399
00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.363
Hey, Nigel, come on.

400
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.406
- We're having fun.
- Now, listen...

401
00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.035
We also established, I think,

402
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.663
that there was someone else,
but I can't remember.

403
00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.040
I think there's someone right here.

404
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.459
I think it's a girl, but I...

405
00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.006
Okay...

406
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.634
- Alright.
- 'Cause I can't re...

407
00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.176
Am I wrong?

408
00:18:58.595 --> 00:18:59.763
I don't... I'm not sure.

409
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.723
I actually don't
look behind me that much.

410
00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.915
It doesn't matter,
don't pay attention to me.

411
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.524
I'm so so sorry.

412
00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:12.276
- It's fine.
- Randy. Randy?

413
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:13.735
I'm Randy the girl.

414
00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:17.573
I had friends that were
women named Randy growing up.

415
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.896
- Yeah, well you got another one, I hope.
- There you go.

416
00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.449
I don't know, if you want to be my friend.
Whatever.

417
00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.888
- It doesn't matter.
- No, you should speak up.

418
00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:25.873
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

419
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:26.790
No.

420
00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.208
No, you shouldn't.

421
00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:34.965
Okay. Is there any questions
anybody has before our test?

422
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.734
Before we get to it,
anything you want to cram.

423
00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:37.801
This is the cram session.

424
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.012
Right, anything you guys
want to talk about, or no?

425
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:43.723
Randy? Anything?

426
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.268
I couldn't possibly.

427
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:48.353
Okay.

428
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.397
Nigel, Stanley, Stanley...

429
00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:55.943
Nigel.

430
00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.298
It's a personal question.

431
00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:01.742
- For me?
- Yeah.

432
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:02.867
Cool.

433
00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:07.623
What's the thing that gets you
really pumped up about contracts?

434
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:13.837
You asked a perfect question.

435
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.216
Once you print them out
and you see them right there.

436
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:18.884
The smell of the paper, right?

437
00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:23.430
But just like you said,
it's just a piece of paper until...

438
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.140
Puff...

439
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:28.810
you sign that thing
and it is legally binding,

440
00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:29.770
just like I said.

441
00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:31.438
Which means, this piece of paper,

442
00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:33.732
which meant absolutely nothing beforehand,

443
00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:37.694
now has the power of law behind it.

444
00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:39.613
Right? And what does "law" mean?

445
00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:40.697
Everybody together.

446
00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.575
- The truth.
- The truth.

447
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:49.873
Law means... Randy!

448
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:51.041
Randy. I didn't hear you.

449
00:20:51.124 --> 00:20:53.168
- What does "law" mean?
- The truth.

450
00:20:53.293 --> 00:20:55.003
No.That's Stanley, Randy.

451
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.339
- Oh!
- Randy.

452
00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.549
Oh, yes.

453
00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.970
Sorry, it's just we've got
two Stanleys and one Randy.

454
00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.223
- The truth.
- The truth.

455
00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:08.600
But... Teach?

456
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.809
Yeah?

457
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.481
What if the contract is digital?

458
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:40.340
Teach, what if the contract is digital?

459
00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:58.984
Should I have not said anything?

460
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:12.998
If the contract's digital...

461
00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.794
then there are no rules.

462
00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:20.796
What?

463
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.134
I've been teaching this class
for 30 years.

464
00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:30.140
I'm, I'm... 60.

465
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.143
I'm pretty funny,
I wear my hat backwards,

466
00:22:33.226 --> 00:22:35.437
- Yeah.
- but I'm, straight up, a 60-year-old guy.

467
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:37.647
I'm still into it...

468
00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:40.733
Daddy.

469
00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:47.699
And no one has ever asked that.

470
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.369
What does it mean when it's digital?

471
00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:54.414
I'm sorry, you're going to have to
find out in the test.

472
00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:57.834
Time's up. Class is dismissed.

473
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.962
Teach? Teach?

474
00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:03.714
Teach?

475
00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:06.425
Teach?

476
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:09.846
So many doors.

477
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.057
Teach?

478
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:15.685
Jesus Christ.

479
00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:19.606
Oh, my god.

480
00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:22.859
I didn't mean to.

481
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:25.195
- It was the first question I asked.
- Way to go, Randy.

482
00:23:25.278 --> 00:23:27.280
It was literally
the first question I asked.

483
00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:28.448
I didn't mean to.

484
00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:30.951
Didn't you know that would
break someone's brain?

485
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.413
No, Stanley, I just assumed
that it would be fine.

486
00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:35.956
Of course you just assumed.

487
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.041
You all do.

488
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:45.339
I got a tote.

489
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.261
I got a tote bag.

490
00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:51.104
If that's not indicative
of my personality...

491
00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:53.098
Just... fucking tote.

492
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.394
Shoulder tote.

493
00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:00.480
Get out of here, Stanley.

494
00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.939
Maybe I will.

495
00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:06.820
It's locked.

496
00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:08.071
We know it's locked.

497
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.533
There's only one. We've learned
there's only one way out.

498
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:14.911
- There's a couple more doors over there.
- Oh, come on.

499
00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:18.498
Don't go through that door.

500
00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:23.670
That's my door.

501
00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:27.215
Stanley, you've got your own private door?

502
00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.136
Only I have the key.

503
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.265
So, please, if you don't mind,
don't go through that door.

504
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.393
Right? Sounds a little bit like it.

505
00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:45.317
What's past that door, Stanley?

506
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.195
American stuff.

507
00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:52.823
It's not the...

508
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:54.575
I mean it's...

509
00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:56.661
It doesn't have anything to do with...

510
00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.705
digital contracts, does it?

511
00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:01.666
It's where I keep...

512
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.960
It's where I keep my secret.

513
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880
Emily?

514
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:10.467
- Do I have a name?
- No. Emily.

515
00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:13.470
- Yes, I'm Emily.
- I wanted to make sure you knew.

516
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.847
- I'm Emily.
- That's where I keep my contracts.

517
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:19.559
Stanley, um...

518
00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:22.394
I think...

519
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.732
I just haven't said how...

520
00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:29.277
um... important you've been to this class

521
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.614
to offer, you know, a new...
American perspective.

522
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.616
American pie.

523
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:36.243
Yeah.

524
00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:37.452
This is crazy.

525
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.955
It's kind of like
The Breakfast Club, right?

526
00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:45.627
- Like, we have the quiet girl.
- Yeah, this is...

527
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.795
We have the quiet girl.

528
00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.380
We have the mean jock.

529
00:25:49.422 --> 00:25:50.422
We have the...

530
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:51.883
American.

531
00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.804
We have the know-it-all girl.

532
00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:57.222
- Know it all?
- Know it all.

533
00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:58.473
Emily, you're very smart.

534
00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.557
Stanley...

535
00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.352
let's just open up your door

536
00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:04.104
and see what's in there.

537
00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:07.190
I mean, I've got to be honest,
the curiosity is killing me.

538
00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:10.193
Who cares?

539
00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:11.861
We all have secrets, right?

540
00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:14.281
Actually, I don't think any one of us

541
00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:16.658
has a secret door in the classroom

542
00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.743
we've been spending our entire semester in

543
00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:20.912
where we keep our secrets.

544
00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:23.622
I'd like to know.

545
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:28.393
What will I get in return?

546
00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:31.338
Huh?

547
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.633
I have a key, I have a door...

548
00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:36.970
behind the door is, like,
so many secrets...

549
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.097
Yeah?

550
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.640
...that only I know.

551
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.184
I give them to you for what?

552
00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.687
What will I get in return?

553
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:47.981
We'll help you pass the test.

554
00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:51.735
Hey, why do you assume
that I couldn't pass it?

555
00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:53.538
- I'm the one that knows things.
- Listen...

556
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:55.613
Okay.

557
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:56.865
Uh...

558
00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.410
I think there's a chance
that maybe you're not from America.

559
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:04.622
What?

560
00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.333
Why would you say that?

561
00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:09.544
Hey, if you're from America...
If you're from America...

562
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:12.255
If you're from America,

563
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.259
what's the best state
in the whole fucking place?

564
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:16.551
Maryland.

565
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.094
He's from America!

566
00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.097
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

567
00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:23.808
We'll help you.

568
00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:26.603
Hey, listen, you said it was a big deal.
You want to pass the test.

569
00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:28.396
What's it going to hurt if all of us help?

570
00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:32.192
I can't promise you
that I can protect you...

571
00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:36.404
from what's behind that door.

572
00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:40.533
Yes, there are secrets to be known,
but there are other things.

573
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.244
Terrible things.

574
00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:46.748
Things that will scar you forever.

575
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.667
I'm sort of turning Werner Herzog now.

576
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.750
Yeah.

577
00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:52.170
Kind of, yeah.

578
00:27:52.253 --> 00:27:54.547
Bounty hunting
is a complicated profession.

579
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:00.636
Trust us.

580
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.930
We're going to be fine.

581
00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:04.515
Okay.

582
00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:07.936
So... are we all going together?

583
00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:10.647
Yeah, if that's what it takes.

584
00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:13.650
I think safety in numbers
is the best type of...

585
00:28:14.317 --> 00:28:15.610
strategy at this point.

586
00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:16.735
Okay. Come on.

587
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.154
Randy. Come on.

588
00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:21.408
Randy, come on.

589
00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:22.742
Stanley.

590
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:24.661
Put your tote bag down. Come on.

591
00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:27.247
I can't bring my tote?

592
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.915
Fine, you can bring your tote.

593
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:33.711
Stanley's here.

594
00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:35.672
- That's everybody, I think, right?
- Yeah.

595
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:36.964
Stanley...

596
00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:37.966
Stanley.

597
00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.134
- Emily.
- Emily.

598
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.343
- Stanley.
- Stanley.

599
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:41.636
- Randy.
- Yeah.

600
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.152
- It's too dangerous.
- What the hell was that?

601
00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:58.403
What the hell was that?

602
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:00.655
What the hell was that?

603
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.115
Stanley?

604
00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.408
Stanley?

605
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:05.993
Stanley?

606
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:07.912
Okay, fine.

607
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.290
You are German now.

608
00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:13.668
I think that's kind of
been pretty clear...

609
00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:14.793
Okay.

610
00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:17.922
- I wasn't playing a joke.
- Someone else had difficulty with it,

611
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.090
- but... okay.
- Okay.

612
00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:21.384
I have to tell you.

613
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.181
I'm not really from America.

614
00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:28.975
We know. We know. We know.

615
00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:32.771
Yeah, come on, man.

616
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:36.065
Uh... you're wearing cinder blocks
as sneakers.

617
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.945
You... you noticed?

618
00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:41.946
Yes.

619
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.591
- Oh, man, that's so crazy.
- Yeah, come on.

620
00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:44.616
Alright, yes.

621
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:46.826
I'm not from America.

622
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:50.622
And you're about to find out
exactly where I'm from

623
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.415
by going through this door.

624
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.002
But, fucking watch out.

625
00:30:06.095 --> 00:30:07.095
I haven't.

626
00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:15.522
This is going to throw a real wrench
in the spokes here.

627
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:16.605
I feel like...

628
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.359
I don't...

629
00:30:19.442 --> 00:30:21.444
I almost don't want to meet this guy...

630
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:26.199
because, like...

631
00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:28.535
It's just...

632
00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:31.079
Yeah?

633
00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:32.247
No, it makes sense.

634
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.706
You know, like Pandora's Box?

635
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.709
It's like, you want to open it,
but you don't want to open it.

636
00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:40.463
Okay, but we've kind of seen
that something crazy's in there.

637
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.842
I suppose to turn our backs on it now
would be unsatisfying.

638
00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:44.925
Yes!

639
00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:51.516
Oh, man.

640
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:55.144
Okay, here we go.

641
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.857
This is what's behind my door of secrets.

642
00:31:05.071 --> 00:31:06.364
This fucking guy.

643
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:10.869
I'm not going...
I'm not going to justify him.

644
00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:13.329
- That's, fucking, someone else's job.
- No! No!

645
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:15.331
That's an alien.

646
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:17.208
That is an alien.
I've heard they live here.

647
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.613
There are aliens that were here.

648
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:20.545
- You've heard they live here?
- Yes.

649
00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.764
Stanley, what the fuck
are you talking about?

650
00:31:22.797 --> 00:31:25.067
What are you talking about?
I heard that aliens are here...

651
00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:26.571
Oh my god, what the fuck is he doing?

652
00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:35.268
What do you want?

653
00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:37.896
What do you want?

654
00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.106
It's not what he wants.

655
00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:43.359
Blah, blah, blah.

656
00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:48.156
He's been looking for something,

657
00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:49.908
- and he can't find it.
- Wait!

658
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:52.577
- Just a quick pause.
- Yes?

659
00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:53.870
I'm still here.

660
00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:55.495
Nigel!

661
00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.416
And I...

662
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.880
And I know exactly what he wants.

663
00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.676
Good old Nigel.

664
00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:11.678
Yes.

665
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:13.305
Yes.

666
00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:17.894
He's not just any alien.

667
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.605
He's a boy.

668
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.738
Don't let him get too far.

669
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:30.948
I'll handle it.

670
00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:33.534
Boy!

671
00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:39.247
Nigel.

672
00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:42.584
Jason!

673
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:44.795
Jason?

674
00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:48.131
Sweet Jason!

675
00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:51.469
Poor, sweet Jason.

676
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:53.972
Trapped and alone...

677
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:56.933
in the Closet of Secrets...

678
00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.652
for all this time.

679
00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:10.446
Years, I'm assuming.

680
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.530
Of course...

681
00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:15.785
leave it to a German/Transylvanian to...

682
00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:18.079
lock you up for that long.

683
00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:21.708
Tell me, boy.

684
00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:26.170
Do you have any friends
in that Closet of Secrets?

685
00:33:26.462 --> 00:33:28.673
No, I don't have any friends.

686
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:32.218
- I'm all by myself in there.
- You're all by yourself in there.

687
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:34.929
- And I'm just a boy.
- And you're just a boy.

688
00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.683
Sweet, Jason.

689
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:41.769
Tell me, child.

690
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:42.853
Sure.

691
00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:48.735
You... do you have but a single friend?

692
00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:55.116
You're lonely, aren't you?

693
00:33:55.742 --> 00:33:58.745
You're a lonely little alien boy
called Jason.

694
00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.206
And Nigel figured it out.

695
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.499
We all forgot about Nigel,

696
00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:05.209
but I'm the one figuring it out.

697
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:10.590
Even though I didn't want
to figure it out.

698
00:34:10.673 --> 00:34:12.967
I wanted nothing to do
with this fucking thing.

699
00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:18.222
- Jason?
- Oh?

700
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.476
I will find you a child.

701
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.061
What?

702
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.856
- I will find you a friend.
- Oh!

703
00:34:26.981 --> 00:34:28.357
I want a friend.

704
00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:29.918
- Of course you do.
- I want a friend.

705
00:34:29.942 --> 00:34:31.652
- I live in the closet.
- I know.

706
00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:33.863
Stay there. Stay there.

707
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:36.115
Let me confer with my associates.

708
00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.325
Just stay right there.

709
00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:38.868
Right here?

710
00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:41.037
Is that okay?

711
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.205
Is that okay?

712
00:34:42.288 --> 00:34:43.581
- Okay.
- Verbal consent.

713
00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:44.999
- Verbal consent.
- Okay.

714
00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.256
Class huddle.

715
00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.134
Jesus Christ.

716
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.513
Class huddle. Everyone around.

717
00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.264
Nigel, that was fucking amazing.

718
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.308
- Quick. Quick. Quick.
- And you're a man.

719
00:35:05.978 --> 00:35:06.978
Yes.

720
00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:10.483
Nigel that was unbelievable...
What...

721
00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:11.651
We need a child.

722
00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:17.156
I am sworn celibate.

723
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.787
And I'm an involuntary...

724
00:35:23.037 --> 00:35:24.163
involun...

725
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:25.248
I'm an incel.

726
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.169
I would fucking love to, but...

727
00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.172
Maryland, so...

728
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:38.052
And I have never had sex either,
so you know.

729
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.720
Fucking virgins?

730
00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:42.681
Randy?

731
00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:44.224
I have two kids.

732
00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:46.518
Randy does?

733
00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:48.688
- No, this is not Randy.
- Okay.

734
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:49.605
This is Emily.

735
00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:50.982
- Yeah.
- Emily. Randy?

736
00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:52.941
I fuck.

737
00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:54.609
Okay.

738
00:35:56.529 --> 00:35:57.780
But I'm safe about it.

739
00:35:57.905 --> 00:35:59.866
- Okay.
- I'm safe. I don't have any children.

740
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:01.075
You're safe... not...

741
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:03.494
So... you fuck all the time.

742
00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:05.579
Yes.

743
00:36:05.955 --> 00:36:07.081
But you, Emily...

744
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.417
You have two children?

745
00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:11.961
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.213
But I don't... I don't...

747
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:15.923
Let me recap the stakes.

748
00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:18.968
He's just sitting there.

749
00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:21.179
I know, I know,
but the stakes couldn't be higher,

750
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:24.307
because I'm going to write them out
here on the chalkboard.

751
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.830
When you see the stakes written out,

752
00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:28.477
you're gonna be like, "You're right.
This is critical."

753
00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:33.858
In but days, we are going
to take a test.

754
00:36:35.943 --> 00:36:37.945
A test, that but moments ago,

755
00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.029
Christina...

756
00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:42.867
failed so hard she was
banished from the school.

757
00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:46.537
Never to be seen or heard from again.

758
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.705
And may I say...

759
00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.624
she got out... no problem.

760
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:50.707
Easy.

761
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.588
- She got out no problem, but the teacher…
- To be honest, I am envious of Christina.

762
00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:57.506
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she left the room.

763
00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.590
Easy peasy.

764
00:36:58.966 --> 00:37:00.259
The teacher went through

765
00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:02.345
the fucking door number three
over there.

766
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:04.012
So...

767
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:07.850
it could be because...

768
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:11.771
of the one thing that she and all of us
did not know,

769
00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:14.314
which is...

770
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.567
What about...

771
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:18.319
digital contracts?

772
00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:23.574
In order to find out

773
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.204
what the consequences
of signing a digital contract is...

774
00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.791
we have to find a child playmate

775
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:34.001
for Jason the Alien.

776
00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:36.879
It's a classic...

777
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.090
"What the Fuck" plot line.

778
00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:43.094
And I'm getting hungry.

779
00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:45.346
Oh boy, and he's hungry.

780
00:37:46.514 --> 00:37:49.141
I'm getting hungry.

781
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.560
- Jason!
- Yes?

782
00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:53.853
Hungry for what?

783
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:58.109
If you say "boys," you're going
to make it real hard to work with you.

784
00:37:58.192 --> 00:37:59.318
- No, no.
- Okay.

785
00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.320
Friends not boys.

786
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:03.781
- You're hungry for friendship.
- I'm hungry for fr...

787
00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:04.907
But I'm also...

788
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:08.411
I'm also hungry
because I've been in the closet

789
00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:09.662
- for a long time.
- Okay.

790
00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:11.580
And... B story...

791
00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:12.999
Jason's hungry.

792
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.960
So, we're going to see if we can

793
00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:17.795
find some food for Jason the Alien.

794
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:19.547
Yes.

795
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:22.883
- I couldn't see her behind the...
- The chalkboard, yes.

796
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:25.886
Um, and if I don't eat...

797
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.680
I get angry.

798
00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:29.724
- Oh, boy the...
- Write it on the board!

799
00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.267
And if...

800
00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:35.187
Which, if unfed, could lead to... anger.

801
00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:38.648
So...

802
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:40.692
Emily?

803
00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:41.652
Yes.

804
00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:42.987
Can you spare a boy?

805
00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:46.282
What are you saying?
What do you want?

806
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:48.701
We want one or both of your children.

807
00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:50.995
You want me to abandon my boy?

808
00:38:57.626 --> 00:38:59.545
I need you to abandon your child.

809
00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.172
Abandon your boy.

810
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:03.174
- Abandon your boy!
- That's what I thought.

811
00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:04.300
Sounded like it was...

812
00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:06.093
Abandon your child, Emily!

813
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.970
Abandon your boy!

814
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.220
Nigel.

815
00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:10.555
Thank you.

816
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.140
Um...

817
00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:15.186
Well, maybe I'll just do the older one.

818
00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:16.645
I would have to call him.

819
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:18.105
I mean, this is necessary?

820
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.816
For all of us to live,
I would have to abandon my boy?

821
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.152
Abandon my child, Milkshake?

822
00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:26.279
I believe so.

823
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:29.867
Okay, I...

824
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.410
Hey... what?

825
00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.042
This way, this way... Yeah.

826
00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:39.959
Sweetie?

827
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:41.698
- What are you doing here?
- Uh...

828
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:42.880
You're supposed to be home.

829
00:39:42.963 --> 00:39:47.343
I know, well, you haven't come home,
and I thought class was over.

830
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:49.345
And so, me and the boys, we...

831
00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:52.014
came by to see how things are going.

832
00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.855
Magic!

833
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:03.275
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

834
00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:06.654
Wait here, Toby, and wait here... Roby.

835
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:12.952
Yeah, what's going on?

836
00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.495
Come to the chalkboard real quick.

837
00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:15.578
Okay.

838
00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:18.707
First of all, thank you
for staying at home.

839
00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:20.042
I don't stay at home.

840
00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:21.794
- I mean, I've got a job...
- Yeah.

841
00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:25.464
You're really helping the family,
and I appreciate that.

842
00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.150
Yeah, I mean, you're
going to help the family too.

843
00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:28.402
- Yeah.
- In more ways than one.

844
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.736
You're not only going to help the family,

845
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.238
- you're going to help the world.
- That's right.

846
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.781
- I'm going to change the world.
- Damn straight.

847
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:33.865
- That's my girl.
- Thank you.

848
00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:35.409
- I love you, baby.
- I'm going to change the world,

849
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.601
and I'm going to come home
for dinner, okay?

850
00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:39.018
Roby?

851
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:40.813
Magic!

852
00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:44.358
Yu-Gi-Oh!

853
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:47.903
Magic!

854
00:40:55.744 --> 00:40:56.784
They've been doing that...

855
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:58.080
- All day.
- ...all fucking day.

856
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.102
- What's going on here?
- We need to give the alien one of our boys

857
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.502
- or we won't pass the test.
- Why?

858
00:41:03.586 --> 00:41:05.355
- Honey, please, no.
- We won't pass the test.

859
00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:06.379
Yes. Go. Look at it.

860
00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:08.923
Solve it.

861
00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:10.801
Shirts.

862
00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.302
Uh...

863
00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:15.431
I mean, I like both of them.

864
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.809
- Yeah, they both have their merits.
- But Roby likes Yu-Gi-Oh, and...

865
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:21.455
- Yeah. Toby loves Magic.
- Toby's a Magic guy.

866
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:22.855
- I love Magic.
- You love Magic.

867
00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:24.565
- That's my shit right there.
- Yeah.

868
00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:28.360
Yu-Gi-Oh, like, I don't think
anyone plays Yu-Gi-Oh still.

869
00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:30.696
I guess we'll find out
in the comments or something.

870
00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:31.779
Yeah.

871
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:37.328
We're going to reignite
this MTG/Yu-Gi-Oh feud

872
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.622
because, I tell you what, hands-down,

873
00:41:39.705 --> 00:41:42.082
I'm going to give the kid
who plays Yu-Gi-Oh up.

874
00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:47.213
Like, honestly, I'm honestly happy
this conundrum is here.

875
00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:50.883
It's so easy for me, it's crazy.

876
00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:53.635
Me?

877
00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:54.677
Roby!

878
00:41:55.054 --> 00:41:56.054
I...

879
00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:58.766
Come here, bud. Come here.

880
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.267
Come here, bud.

881
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.351
Come here, buddy.

882
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:04.522
- Do I have your consent?
- Of course?

883
00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.400
- Oh, I love you.
- Hey, pal.

884
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:09.484
What's up?

885
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.780
Um... you like making new friends, right?

886
00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:14.865
Oh my god, I love making new friends
all the time.

887
00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:15.783
Okay.

888
00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:19.954
Would you like it if one
of those friends was a fucking alien?

889
00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:22.121
Are you kidding me?

890
00:42:22.164 --> 00:42:24.083
I play Yu-Gi-Oh, I would love that.

891
00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:26.210
Looks like this is a match
made in heaven.

892
00:42:26.293 --> 00:42:27.670
What do you want me to do?

893
00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.214
I want you to go behind that chalkboard...

894
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:32.967
and make friends
with an alien called Jason.

895
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.052
I'm surprisingly chill with all of this.

896
00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:37.137
You're a cool dad.

897
00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:39.890
You mean that, pal?

898
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:42.017
Yeah, I've always respected you, Dad.

899
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.520
I've always... I've tolerated you.

900
00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:47.940
I just want you to know
I think you're the best,

901
00:42:48.023 --> 00:42:50.693
and if I've been a little bit weird
or anything, I'll be better.

902
00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:52.152
I'm growing up. I'm the youngest.

903
00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:53.236
- Okay?
- Yeah.

904
00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:56.115
Fads come and go, but my love for you
will always stay the same.

905
00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:59.118
So what did you want me to do?

906
00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.789
Hey, Dad! Uh...

907
00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:05.165
I just want you to know,

908
00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:08.085
I rank Magic: The Gathering
higher than my love for you.

909
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.339
But it's MTG.

910
00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:14.842
♪ It's Magic ♪

911
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:17.719
Go that way, Roby.

912
00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.138
Toby, can you take a seat?

913
00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.682
Out of the way, dork-a-zoid.

914
00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:23.684
Yeah, lap time.

915
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:25.394
I'm 12.

916
00:43:28.397 --> 00:43:30.877
- I'm 12. I love my dad's lap.
- Hey, stop. Toby, Toby, Toby...

917
00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.528
Get your hair out of your face, Toby.

918
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.322
Get your long hair out of your face.

919
00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:37.865
Yeah, tie it up.

920
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.325
My hair's down to my butt.

921
00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:41.869
I play Magic: The Gathering,
and I love my dad's lap.

922
00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:43.245
I'm Toby!

923
00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.039
I've got a million friends.

924
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.416
You want to make one more?

925
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:50.294
Ah, sure, I guess. If I can fit them in.

926
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.964
Go on the other side
of that chalkboard.

927
00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:55.883
- There's an alien there.
- Alright.

928
00:43:57.259 --> 00:43:58.259
You had a good run.

929
00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:13.233
Urrr?

930
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:15.944
- Toby.
- Jason.

931
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.820
Jason?

932
00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:18.946
Toby?

933
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.324
Toby.

934
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.575
I'm hungry.

935
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:28.123
Well, I think I got a Snickers.

936
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:30.709
A candy bar?

937
00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:32.168
A candy bar.

938
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.963
Oh, sorry, I think
I got a generic candy bar.

939
00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:41.845
- I'm hungry.
- Ah...

940
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:44.639
Let me have it.

941
00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:46.265
Okay.

942
00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:52.146
Okay...

943
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:53.231
What's that card?

944
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.150
- This card?
- What's that card?

945
00:44:57.778 --> 00:44:59.446
- Friend.
- Okay.

946
00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.781
- Friend.
- Friend.

947
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:01.782
Um-huh.

948
00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:02.950
Come to my closet.

949
00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:05.786
Come to your closet?

950
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:06.911
Come, come.

951
00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:08.038
Okay.

952
00:45:08.163 --> 00:45:09.873
Come, come, little boy.

953
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:15.337
Should we be doing anything?

954
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:17.964
Dad?

955
00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:22.553
Jason's taking me to his closet.

956
00:45:25.013 --> 00:45:26.014
Um...

957
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.308
Uh, Jason!

958
00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:29.768
Before you go...

959
00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:30.852
Roger.

960
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.231
What happens...

961
00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:37.359
if the contract is digital?

962
00:45:40.654 --> 00:45:42.072
You've got your boy.

963
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:43.949
You're not hungry anymore.

964
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.619
It's time for you to live up
to your end of the bargain.

965
00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:49.329
It's time for you to uphold...

966
00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.373
the verbal contract.

967
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:55.002
Emily, if this is what you want, okay...

968
00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.128
If you want to be...

969
00:45:56.503 --> 00:45:58.422
a fancy lawyer and change the world,

970
00:45:58.505 --> 00:45:59.840
the only way for that to happen

971
00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:03.010
is for you to give up our... the son
that I like less.

972
00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:05.971
Are you going to be cool in there?

973
00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:08.015
Jason, are you going to treat him okay?

974
00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.392
No.

975
00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:16.398
- It would have made it easier.
- I'm going to treat him horribly.

976
00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.222
First tell us about the digital.

977
00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.404
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.366
Fair is fair.

979
00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:27.951
Let him talk, guys.

980
00:46:28.035 --> 00:46:29.036
Fair if fair.

981
00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.704
But, what did I tell you?

982
00:46:30.996 --> 00:46:32.664
I get the boy.

983
00:46:33.332 --> 00:46:35.876
- I get the boy all to myself.
- Yes, yes.

984
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:37.002
In my closet.

985
00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:38.504
Yes.

986
00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:41.215
It's just me, also a boy...

987
00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:42.716
and this boy.

988
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800
Yes.

989
00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:45.218
Great.

990
00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.763
What's the difference
between digital contracts?

991
00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.517
The only difference...

992
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:54.853
is that you have to sign...

993
00:46:55.562 --> 00:46:56.730
digitally.

994
00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:02.694
- Oh!
- Uh, uh, uh.

995
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.322
- We never signed anything.
- Uh?

996
00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:07.241
- We never shook hands.
- Uh?

997
00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:09.618
A contract isn't a contract

998
00:47:09.785 --> 00:47:11.870
until two parties have signed.

999
00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.206
Give the boy back.

1000
00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:17.543
- You lose, Jason.
- Ah...

1001
00:47:17.626 --> 00:47:19.419
- You lose, Jason.
- Ah...

1002
00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:20.546
Come, hold my hand.

1003
00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:21.797
Yes, you Randy.

1004
00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:24.591
Yes, Randy hold my hand.

1005
00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:26.844
Hand. Hold my hand.

1006
00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:28.679
And you, Stanley,
hold Randy's hand.

1007
00:47:29.054 --> 00:47:31.056
- I'm not holding no girl's head.
- Fuck!

1008
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.226
Other Stanley.

1009
00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.186
Oh, the husband-man.

1010
00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:38.313
Me? Yeah, I'm your husband.

1011
00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:40.023
Hold, hold, hold, hold that, please.

1012
00:47:40.107 --> 00:47:41.859
Okay, you want to hold my hand?

1013
00:47:41.942 --> 00:47:43.502
You have to let the man
touch your hand,

1014
00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:44.611
or he won't touch you.

1015
00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.005
- Stanley, touch his hand.
- Yeah, Stanley.

1016
00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:46.864
- Great.
- Yeah, okay.

1017
00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:49.908
Now I will. I'll hold a superior hand.

1018
00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:52.661
Emily, grab his hand.

1019
00:47:53.078 --> 00:47:54.078
Wait...

1020
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:55.831
- Emily. Who are you?
- Nigel, of course.

1021
00:47:55.914 --> 00:47:56.914
Okay.

1022
00:47:59.251 --> 00:48:01.169
- Come on, he's really...
- Don't you touch me.

1023
00:48:01.795 --> 00:48:02.795
Fuck. All right.

1024
00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.923
- Okay.
- I'll hold it.

1025
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.007
It's me, Roby.

1026
00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:08.510
- Roby, great.
- I'll act as a male buffer.

1027
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.014
Roby, I'm so happy we kept you.

1028
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:15.099
Great.

1029
00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.102
Okay, that's man, man, boy...

1030
00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:18.436
And then...

1031
00:48:18.645 --> 00:48:19.688
- Emily.
- Emily.

1032
00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:21.857
- And that's everything.
- That's everybody.

1033
00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:23.108
Pull.

1034
00:48:23.191 --> 00:48:24.191
Pull!

1035
00:48:24.526 --> 00:48:25.526
Pull!

1036
00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:29.697
Yeah!

1037
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.078
No!

1038
00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:49.593
Jesus absolute holy fucking Christ.

1039
00:49:05.317 --> 00:49:06.317
Yeah.

1040
00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:09.154
Me and the boys put this together.

1041
00:49:09.237 --> 00:49:11.073
A couple of fucking pranksters.

1042
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:15.410
What do you mean? Is this a joke?

1043
00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:16.995
When I left this room,

1044
00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:19.998
how many of you knew what happens
in a digital contract?

1045
00:49:25.003 --> 00:49:26.755
Down the line, everybody down the line.

1046
00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:29.675
I wouldn't know, I don't take this class.

1047
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.846
Okay, Teach. Emily...

1048
00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:40.143
This whole thing was to just...

1049
00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:43.105
teach us what a digital contract means?

1050
00:49:43.188 --> 00:49:44.856
You planned this whole thing?

1051
00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:47.150
I'm a cool fucking teacher.

1052
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:50.779
Me, the pranksters, the boys...

1053
00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.322
Yeah.

1054
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:53.949
He really ripped off his arm.

1055
00:49:55.742 --> 00:49:56.868
But it was funny, huh?

1056
00:50:00.205 --> 00:50:01.205
Yeah, it was.

1057
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:04.209
It was pretty funny.

1058
00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.503
Hey, you know what?

1059
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.006
All it took was a...

1060
00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:10.757
a jock, a freak...

1061
00:50:14.052 --> 00:50:16.054
Uh... a know-it-all...

1062
00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:18.849
an Englishman...

1063
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.351
an American...

1064
00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:26.189
- Yeah.
- And togetherness.

1065
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:28.024
And togetherness.

1066
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.031
That's our show!
